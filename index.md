## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

For quiet a while I am exploring tools and approaches for DevOps driving software development. As part of my last coursework of [Spring 2017 - Advanced Science Gateway Architectures](http://courses.airavata.org/) I get to explore a variety of technologies for [Apache Airavata](https://airavata.apache.org/) software framework. 

### List of topics discussed on my pages
- [Setting up an automated local development environment using Docker and Vagrant](docs/dev-environment.md) 
- [Integration of Docker and Vagrant tools with popular IDEs](docs/docker-and-vagrant-with-IDE.md)
